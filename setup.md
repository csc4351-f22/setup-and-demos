## Python installations
If you already have pip installed, run
```
pip install flask
pip install requests
pip install python-dotenv
```

If you don't have pip and you're on a Mac, run
```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

If you're on WSL and need pip, do
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
then run the installations above.

If you're on Powershell, best of luck to you.
